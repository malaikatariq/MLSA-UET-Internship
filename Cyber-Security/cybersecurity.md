# 🔐 Cybersecurity Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Learning Journey** repository.  
This repo contains weekly tasks, assignments, and notes as I practice ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security analysis step by step.  

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this repository are:
- To document my **learning progress** in cybersecurity.  
- To practice **hands-on tasks** like information gathering, port scanning, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation in a legal/controlled environment.  
- To create a structured **portfolio** that showcases my cybersecurity skills and growth.  
- To make it easier to **revisit concepts** later and share knowledge with others.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used *(Educational Purpose Only)*
Some tools I will use during this learning journey:  

### 🔹 Virtualization & OS
- **VMware Workstation / VMware Player** – to create isolated virtual labs.  
- **Kali Linux** – penetration testing distribution with pre-installed security tools.  

### 🔹 Reconnaissance & Scanning
- **Whois** – for domain registration details.  
- **Wappalyzer** – for technology stack identification.  
- **Nmap** – for port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability scanning.

⚠️ **Important:** All tools listed above are used **strictly for educational purposes only** within safe, legal, and controlled environments (labs, test servers, or intentionally vulnerable machines). They must **not** be used on unauthorized systems.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All tasks and exercises in this repository are performed in a **controlled, ethical, and educational environment**.  
Do **not** use these techniques or tools on unauthorized systems. Unauthorized hacking is illegal.

## ✨ Future Goals
- Cover **Web Application Security** (OWASP Top 10).  
- Explore **Cloud Security** basics.  
- Practice **Red Team / Blue Team** scenarios.  
- Document and share more **real-world lab exercises**.
