# 🔐 Cybersecurity Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Learning Journey** repository.  
This repo contains weekly tasks, assignments, and notes as I practice ethical hacking step by step.  

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this repository are:
- To document my **learning progress** in cybersecurity.  
- To practice **hands-on tasks** like information gathering, port scanning, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation in a legal/controlled environment.  
- To create a structured **portfolio** that showcases my cybersecurity skills and growth.  
- To make it easier to **revisit concepts** later and share knowledge with others.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used *(Educational Purpose Only)*
Some tools I will use during this learning journey:  

### 🔹 Virtualization & OS
- **VMware Workstation / VirtualBox** – to create isolated virtual labs.  
- **Kali Linux** – penetration testing distribution.  
- **Windows 10/11** – target practice OS.  
- **Ubuntu Linux** – for Linux-based tasks.  

### 🔹 Reconnaissance & Scanning
- **Whois** – for domain registration details.  
- **Wappalyzer** – for technology stack identification.  
- **Nmap** – for port scanning and service detection.  

### 🔹 Network Analysis
- **Wireshark** – packet capture and analysis.  
- **Ettercap** – for ARP spoofing and MITM demonstrations.  

### 🔹 Vulnerability & Exploitation
- **Metasploit** – exploitation framework.  
- **John the Ripper** – password cracking.  
- **Hashcat** – advanced password recovery.  

### 🔹 Web Security
- **Burp Suite** – web application testing.  
- **OWASP ZAP** – security scanning tool.  

### 🔹 Defensive Tools
- **Windows Defender Firewall** – host-based firewall.  
- **iptables** – Linux firewall utility.  
- **PowerShell/Bash** – automation and scripting.  

⚠️ **Important:** All tools listed above are used **strictly for educational purposes only** within safe, legal, and controlled environments (labs, test servers, or intentionally vulnerable machines). They must **not** be used on unauthorized systems.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository and all activities within it are **strictly for educational purposes**.  
- All tests, labs, and demonstrations are performed in **my own isolated virtual lab environment**.  
- No real-world systems, networks, or services are harmed, scanned, or accessed without explicit permission.  
- I do not condone or support any form of malicious hacking.  
- Unauthorized testing of computer systems is **illegal and unethical**.

## ✨ Future Goals
- Cover **Web Application Security** (OWASP Top 10).  
- Explore **Cloud Security** basics (AWS/Azure).  
- Practice **Red Team / Blue Team** scenarios.  
- Document and share more **real-world lab exercises**.  
- Obtain entry-level cybersecurity certifications.
