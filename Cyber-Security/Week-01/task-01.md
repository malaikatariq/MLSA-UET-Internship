# **Task-01 Report: Demonstrating Session Hijacking via Cookie Theft**

## **Disclaimer**

**This report and the described activity are for educational purposes only.** This demonstration was conducted in a controlled, ethical environment as part of a cybersecurity internship to understand attack vectors and strengthen defenses. **Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or user accounts is illegal and unethical.** This report is intended to:
*   Educate developers and security professionals on a critical vulnerability.
*   Highlight the importance of secure cookie attributes.
*   Promote better security practices for protecting user sessions.

## **Overview**

This task demonstrates the real-world impact of **session hijacking**, a critical web application vulnerability. The objective was to practically understand how stolen session cookies can be used to gain unauthorized access to a user's account without requiring a username or password, completely bypassing authentication mechanisms. The target service in this demonstration was Netflix, but the vulnerability applies to any website that relies on session cookies for authentication.

## **Key Objectives**

*   To research how stolen session data is traded online.
*   To demonstrate the ease of using browser tools to import stolen session cookies.
*   To successfully gain access to a user account using only stolen cookie data, highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
*   To analyze the security implications and propose mitigation strategies.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**

*   **Web Browser:** Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox
*   **Browser Extensions:** Cookie-Editor
*   **Search Engines:** Google, DuckDuckGo (to find publicly-discussed threats)

## **Methodology & Walkthrough**

The following steps were performed in a isolated, sandboxed environment to avoid any interference with real user accounts.

### **1. Reconnaissance: Finding Stolen Session Data**

Searched for keywords like `"live Netflix cookies"`, `"working Netflix cookies txt"`, and `"Netflix premium cookies"` on search engines and certain forums. These searches often lead to:
*   Posts on hacker forums and Telegram channels.
*   Pastebin-like websites where users share text snippets, including stolen cookie data.
*   Tutorials on how to use such cookies.

**Finding:** These "cookies" are typically strings of text containing key-value pairs (e.g., `nfvdid=ABC123; Secure; Domain=.netflix.com`).

### **2. Preparation: Installing the Necessary Tool**

The **Cookie-Editor** browser extension was installed from the official Chrome Web Store. This tool provides a clean interface to view, edit, create, and import cookies in JSON format, which is far more efficient than using the browser's built-in developer tools.

### **3. Execution: Importing the Stolen Session**

1.  Navigated to `netflix.com`. The browser automatically redirected to the login page.
2.  Opened the **Cookie-Editor** extension.
3.  **Deleted all existing Netflix cookies.** This simulates a fresh, unauthenticated state.
4.  Used the **"Import"** function in Cookie-Editor.
5.  Pasted the copied cookie string (often in a JSON array format) into the import box and confirmed.
6.  The extension populated the browser's cookie storage with all the stolen key-value pairs, including the critical authentication token.

### **4. Access: Completing the Hijack**

After importing the cookies, the Netflix website was simply refreshed.

**Result:** Instead of seeing the login page, the browser successfully loaded the homepage of the victim's Netflix account, displaying their profile picture, list of profiles, and continued watching recommendations. Full access to the account was achieved without ever knowing the user's email or password.

## **Technical Analysis & Underlying Vulnerability**

This attack exploits the fundamental way HTTP sessions work. HTTP is a stateless protocol, so cookies are used to tell the server, "This is who I am." The critical failure is:

*   **The Authentication Token (Session Cookie) is Compromised.** If an attacker can steal this single string of text, they can impersonate the user for the duration of the session.
*   **Lack of Secure Attributes:** For this attack to work over insecure networks, the cookies likely lacked the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags. However, even with these, if the token is stolen directly from a user's machine (e.g., via malware, XSS), hijacking is still possible.
*   **Long Session Lifetimes:** Premium account cookies are often valid for long periods (weeks or months), making them extremely valuable targets.

## **Impact & Risk Assessment**

| Risk Level | Impact Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | **Full Account Takeover:** An attacker gains complete access to the victim's Netflix account. |
| **High** | **Privacy Violation:** Viewing of user's viewing history, preferences, and personal details. |
| **Medium** | **Financial Loss:** The victim may be locked out of a service they pay for. |
| **Reputational** | **Loss of Trust:** Erosion of user trust in the platform's security. |

## **Defensive Recommendations & Mitigations**

Understanding this attack vector allows us to recommend robust defenses:

1.  **For Service Providers (e.g., Netflix):**
    *   **Implement Token Binding:** Bind the session cookie to the user's original device or browser fingerprint, making it useless elsewhere.
    *   **Short Session Timeouts:** Implement shorter durations for highly privileged sessions.
    *   **Monitor for Abnormal Activity:** Deploy systems that detect simultaneous logins from geographically impossible locations (e.g., a login from the US followed minutes later by one in Europe).
    *   **Rotate Session Tokens:** Invalidate old sessions and issue new tokens upon significant events like a password change.

2.  **For Developers:**
    *   **Always set the `Secure` attribute** to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
    *   **Always set the `HttpOnly` attribute** to prevent cookies from being accessed by client-side JavaScript, mitigating XSS attacks.
    *   **Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` or `Strict`** to protect against CSRF attacks and some cross-site leakage.

3.  **For End Users:**
    *   **Log out** of sensitive accounts on shared computers.
    *   **Use a reputable antivirus/anti-malware** solution to prevent info-stealing malware.
    *   **Be cautious of phishing attempts** and malicious links that could lead to cookie theft.

## **Conclusion**

This exercise successfully demonstrated the severe consequences of session cookie theft. It underscores that a compromised password is not the only way to lose control of an account. Security is a multi-layered effort requiring vigilance from both service providers (through secure coding practices and robust monitoring) and end-users (through safe browsing habits). Defending against session hijacking requires making the authentication token unusable outside of its intended context.
