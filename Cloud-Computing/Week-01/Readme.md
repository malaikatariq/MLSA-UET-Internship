# 🌩️ Cloud Computing – Week 1  

## 📖 Concepts Learned  

### ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?  
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of computing services** (servers, storage, networking, databases, software, etc.) over the internet.  
Instead of owning physical hardware, you can rent resources from cloud providers like **Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud**, paying only for what you use.

### 🌐 Cloud Deployment Models  
1. **Public Cloud**  
   - Services offered over the internet by third-party providers (e.g., Azure, AWS).  
   - Scalable, cost-efficient, but shared infrastructure.  

2. **Private Cloud**  
   - Cloud infrastructure used by a single organization.  
   - Offers more control and security but requires higher investment.  

3. **Hybrid Cloud**  
   - Combination of public and private cloud.  
   - Flexible, secure, and commonly used in enterprises.

### ⚙️ Cloud Service Models  
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
   - Provides virtualized computing resources like VMs, storage, and networking.  
   - Example: Azure Virtual Machines.  

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
   - Provides a development platform to build and deploy apps without managing infrastructure.  
   - Example: Azure App Service.  

3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
   - Provides ready-to-use applications over the internet.  
   - Example: Microsoft 365, Gmail.

## 🛠️ Task-01 – Getting Started with Azure  

### ✅ Objectives  
- Create an Azure account using student email.  
- Convert CV/Resume from PDF to HTML & CSS.  
- Upload CV files to GitHub repo.  
- Deploy resume as a **Static Web App** on Azure.  
- Document the entire progress.  
- Share the milestone on LinkedIn.  

---

### 🔎 Steps Performed  

1. **Created Azure Account**  
   - Signed up with student email to receive **$200 free credits**.  

2. **Converted Resume**  
   - Took my existing CV in PDF format.  
   - Rebuilt it using **HTML + CSS** for clean and responsive design.  

3. **Uploaded to GitHub**  
   - Pushed project files (`index.html`, `style.css`) into a **public repository**.  

4. **Deployed on Azure Static Web Apps**  
   - Linked my GitHub repo with Azure Static Web Apps.  
   - Configured branch for automatic deployment.  
   - Verified deployment URL (web app live on Azure).  

5. **Documented Progress**  
   - Created a `README.md` in my repo.  
   - Added explanation, steps, and screenshots of the process.  

6. **Shared on LinkedIn**  
   - Wrote a short post about my **first cloud project**, mentioning MLSA UET internship and Azure.

### 📸 Screenshots  
(Save screenshots in the `assets/` folder and link them here)  

- Azure Free Credit Activation  
- GitHub repo upload  
- Azure Static Web App deployment confirmation  
- Live website screenshot  

---

### 🎯 Outcome  
- Learned about cloud basics, deployment & service models.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **Azure Static Web Apps**.  
- Successfully deployed my **Resume website** on Azure.  

---

### 📝 Reflection  
This was my **first practical step in Cloud Computing**. I understood the difference between theory (cloud models, IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) and practice (deployment on Azure).  
It gave me confidence in using cloud resources and documenting my progress properly.
