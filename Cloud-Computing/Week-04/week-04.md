# **Week 4 – Project & Quiz Report**

## **Overview**

In **Week 4**, I completed a hands-on project using **Azure Computer Vision** integrated with a **Static Web App** and **Function App**, along with a **quiz activity** focused on fundamental Azure concepts.

This week strengthened both my **practical implementation skills** and **theoretical understanding** of Azure services.

## **Project Task**

### **Project Title:**

**Image to Text Extraction Web App using Azure Computer Vision**

### **Description:**

I built a **static web application** where users can upload an image, and the app extracts text from it using **Azure Computer Vision OCR API**.

### **Key Components:**

* **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS):** User interface for image upload.
* **Azure Function App:** Backend serverless function to process requests.
* **Azure Computer Vision:** Performs OCR on the uploaded images.
* **Azure Static Web Apps:** Hosting the frontend.

### **Architecture Flow:**

```text
User (Browser) → Static Web App (UI) → Function App → Azure Computer Vision → Extracted Text
```

### **Outcome:**

* Successfully deployed the web app on **Azure Static Web Apps**.
* User can upload an image → Function App sends it to Computer Vision → Extracted text is displayed in real-time.

1. **Azure Core Services**

   * Resource Groups, Subscriptions, Regions, and Availability Zones
   * Compute services (VMs, App Services, Functions)
   * Networking (VNet, Subnet, Peering)

2. **Azure Storage**

   * Blob, Table, Queue, File storage
   * Redundancy (LRS, GRS, ZRS)

3. **Azure Identity & Security**

   * Azure AD
   * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   * Authentication methods

4. **Azure Cost & Governance**

   * Pricing models
   * Resource monitoring
   * Cost management
